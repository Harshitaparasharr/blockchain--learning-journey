Constructor in Solidity
ðŸ”¹ Definition

A constructor is a special function in Solidity that runs only once, when the contract is deployed.

Used to initialize state variables or set up contract logic at the time of deployment.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points

Declared with the keyword constructor.

Executed automatically at contract deployment.

Cannot be called again after deployment.

Only one constructor is allowed per contract.

Can be public (default) or internal.

If not defined, Solidity creates a default empty constructor.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyProfile {
    string public name;
    uint public number;

    // Constructor runs once at deployment
    constructor(string memory new_name, uint new_number) {
        name = new_name;
        number = new_number;
    }
}
