pure Functions

Definition: Functions marked with pure cannot read or modify state variables.

Use case: When you only need to work with local variables, parameters, or calculations, not the blockchain state.

Gas cost: Same as view â€” free when called externally, but costs gas if used inside a transaction.

    function getter () public pure returns (uint) {
        uint roll= 204;
