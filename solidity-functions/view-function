view Functions

Definition: Functions marked with view can read state variables but cannot modify them.

Use case: When you want to read data from the blockchain without making changes.

Gas cost:

If called externally (without a transaction) → no gas is used.

If called inside another transaction → still consumes gas because blockchain execution is happening.

contract global { 
uint public age = 20;
    function getter () public view returns (uint) {
        return age;
    }
    }
